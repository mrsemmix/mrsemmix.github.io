# PokerMon Implementation Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the steps to refactor the existing PokerMon codebase to properly support both offline (vs AI) and online (multiplayer) modes while maintaining consistent game mechanics.

```

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Refactor Core Game Logic

- Replace existing `pokermon-core.js`, `pokermon-engine.js`, and `pokermon-utils.js` with our new modular approach
- Keep the same betting logic and game flow to ensure compatibility
- Extract element-related functionality into `element-utils.js`

### 2. Create Client-Side Mode Controller

- Implement `mode-controller.js` to handle switching between online and offline modes
- Ensure proper initialization of game in both modes
- Connect to server via socket.io in online mode

### 3. Implement UI Controller

- Refactor UI rendering from existing code in `pokermon-main.js`
- Create clean interfaces for all game events
- Support both offline and online modes through the same UI components

### 4. Server Implementation

- Implement the server using the shared `game-manager.js`
- Handle room creation and management
- Process player actions and broadcast updates
- Ensure game state consistency

### 5. AI Improvements

- Implement improved AI using personality traits
- Consider element bonuses in AI decision making
- Make AI behavior more realistic and challenging

## Migration Process

To minimize disruption, we'll implement this refactoring in stages:

1. **Create new files alongside existing code**
   - This allows for incremental testing without breaking functionality

2. **Replace functionality one component at a time**
   - Start with core game logic
   - Then implement mode controller
   - Finally replace UI handling

3. **Testing**
   - Test each component in isolation
   - Conduct integration testing for offline mode
   - Test multiplayer functionality

4. **Deployment**
   - Deploy server components
   - Update client code
   - Perform final testing

## Best Practices

- Maintain consistent naming conventions
- Use proper error handling
- Add detailed comments for complex logic
- Ensure code reusability where possible
- Separate concerns between game logic, rendering, and networking

## Compatibility Notes

- The new implementation maintains the same betting logic as the original
- Player positions and turn management work the same way
- Card values and element bonuses remain unchanged
- UI appearance will be preserved

## Timeline

1. Core Game Logic Refactoring: 1-2 days
2. Mode Controller Implementation: 1 day
3. UI Controller Refactoring: 1-2 days
4. Server Implementation: 1-2 days
5. AI Improvements: 1 day
6. Testing and Debugging: 1-2 days

Total estimated time: 6-10 days
